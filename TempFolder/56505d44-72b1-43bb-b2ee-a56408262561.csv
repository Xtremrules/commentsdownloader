I'm just wondering how does these food box subscriptions MAKE there food before packaging. AND WHERE DO THEY GET IT. Is it all done in a restaurant or a factory.

"Jiayi Shou",6/4/2018 1:27:23 AM,"none","My Hello Fresh box is completely on the opposite. Meals are individually wrapped in paper bags. Quality and the amount of the produce is simply PATHETIC. The salmon has orange food coloring  (what kind of salmon has orange color in the juice? just gross). The tomato arrived moldy. The cucumber is tiny and soggy.... In terms of the recipe, again PATHETIC. I do way much better myself. On the contrary, Blue Apron I have ordered a couple times. Everytime I want to try new recipes, I order Blue Apron.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGK86tWMFjk&lc=UgwyKWn1D6RrgdBzp4V4AaABAg"

"Candy Cane Pie",6/1/2018 6:36:03 PM,"none","When I go grocery shopping I tend to overspend trying to stock up, so these recipe ingredient delivery services are awesome!  I love to cook in the evenings and try new recipes, but it‚Äôs just my daughter and I so there used to be too many leftovers, with these it‚Äôs just enough for our dinner and enough for my lunch the next day.  I LOVE getting all the healthy produce delivered to us.  

Home Chef and Terra Kitchen offer fruit and salad options, and Marley Spoon and Plated have unique recipes also. We switch off with all of these every week depending what fruit or produce we need or what meals we‚Äôre craving.  I‚Äôve cooked over 100 new healthy recipes in the past year with these services and saved money, plus we eat healthier.

Just the right amount of food.  The one thing that really irked me when I went to sign back up with Hello Fresh after having stopped for a while is that they are charging more for things like Steak dinners now.  It used to be choose what you like.  Plus I had gone there due to an ad they sent me advertising getting a steak dinner for Valentines day...but if I wanted it..I would have had to pay extra....not cool!

"Ga Me",5/15/2018 9:59:11 PM,"none","I feel like it could actually be worth it for recipes that have a lot of different ingredients. I've bought different seasonings just for a single recipe. After all said and done it can cost $20-$30 to get all the different stuff for some random recipe you want to make. i spent $50 on ""authentic"" Ramen ingredients to make a few bowls of Ramen, for instance. That said, several of the meals I've seen on reviews were rather simple and could have been extremely easy to shop for and quite a bit cheaper. The only real advantage to these services is pure convenience. You're much better off going on Pinterest and finding recipes. My wife has made all sorts of extremely delicious, cheap and healthy dinners all from random Pinterest pins she finds.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGK86tWMFjk&lc=UgynZMF5MWsCE_5CTDd4AaABAg"

"Darla",4/9/2018 5:56:40 AM,"none","We tried Blue Apron. I was very impressed by the freshness of the produce especially. I found sorting out the box fun the first time, then it DID become like a chore. It was nice to not need to go to the grocery store because I was suffering neck and back pain at the time. I liked the recipes but exactly as you stated in this video, there wasn‚Äôt any leftovers. That can be a good thing for some people, but we like to have at least one serving of leftovers to tote to workplace. The family missed our regular recipes that I am sooo tired of making.Stopping the service & restarting was absolutely no issue, they had great customer service. A couple comments on the price...yes you can go to the store and buy those ingredients cheaply, but there can be the additional expenses from the add-on purchases, those other ‚Äúgood deals, ‚Äú the Easter product clearance junk ...also I think these meals in a box with the photos of every step are a good way for tweens to start learning to cook.

"Fluffymiyster",3/5/2018 1:35:55 AM,"none","For three meals for two people with HelloFresh, I'd pay about $60 a week, so $20 a meal. Hm. If I times that by four, that's $240 in one month with them. I maybe spend about $100 to $150 monthly on food for me and my brother though I might be able to find ways to cut that down. So, as awesome as the convenience is, I think I'm going to stick with normal shopping. I like shopping anyways but I wanted to see if it'd save me any money. Even if I only did it two weeks out of a month, three meals a week would be $120, nearly the amount I spend for an entire month. I might still try it once but this indeed is a bit rich for my pockets.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGK86tWMFjk&lc=UgyGrkVZi01kL_Ig0pt4AaABAg"

"Know Better",2/26/2018 10:24:51 PM,"none","You don't actually save money doing the subscriptions because the food that you get are in small quantities. And reality if you go to the grocery store and buy in larger quantities you will end up saving more money. Because the Mills you get to subscriptions are made for one time. Versus going to the store and buying a whole Shaker of garlic salt or pepper. In these recipes you'll get like a little packet of each. But they're about $10 per meal that's three Square meals a day which equals out to $30. Not mentioning the snacks you have to have in between. And I'm talking about healthy meals. And you have to eat between or I should rather say every 4 hours a day. Healthy meals and healthy snacks.

But that comes to 30 times 7 equals $210 per week. There are four week sometime 5 weeks in a month. So that comes out to $840 if it's 4 weeks in the month. And I'll just stop there if my math is fuzzy put feel free to correct it but you understand what I'm saying. Now this is just for one person. Now I really just did my grocery bill for 2 people eating healthy. And it turned into $451 for the month. And that was two people. Then you have to add into dietary needs. As if you are type 1 or type 2 diabetic or have any other medical issues that are affected by the food that you eat. So I really appreciate this video but I would really like someone to do this video for people who have much more restrictive diet. Now if you have the almost $900 a month to spare on groceries that's fine. But at the end of the day you will always say more money going to the grocery store yourself. You say even more money if your have the ability to go to a farmers market where you don't have to play for plastic and packaging and all those things. Great video though","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGK86tWMFjk&lc=UgwYBirhf4kY1OJcKgx4AaABAg"

However, I feel that Blue Apron offers more interesting food options.  Also, a bit more of the preparation effort is on the cook; which helps refine your cooking skills.  My biggest problem with Hello Fresh was that they use farm raised salmon.  In contrast, Blue Apron sends wild caught Alaskan salmon.  Purely based on this issue, I think Blue Apron gives you better quality and will remain my home kit meal of choice.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGK86tWMFjk&lc=UgwkiWpjGTQB1Kr6bKd4AaABAg"

We decided to give it a try because it is just us, no kids, and we both work so time to cook is limited.  I cannot stand having to throw food away that we cook and aren't at home to eat it so it goes bad.  With this service, you get just enough food for one meal, three nights a week, plus perhaps a tad bit of leftover, and there is no throw away.  I personally think it is a bit expensive, but for us it's still cheaper than what we would spend at the grocery store, and we don't throw away food.

Personally, I'd never give up the freedom of getting the quantities you want at much reasonable prices, and the freedom to tweak recipes as you see fit because you can get any ingredient you want when you're planning to cook! I'd be willing to subscribe to a service that recommends recipes for everyday and prepares a list of ingredients for the week but allows for the freedom of shopping for myself.

"Uwe Schroeder",9/29/2017 4:59:30 AM,"none","I think it's a really bad testament to our society that services like that even exist.  The only thing you save is a little bit of time to go to a grocery store (time most people can easily make up for by not playing with their cellphones for - 30 minutes).
I currently run our household of 2 on $12/day (for food) - that is 2 meals for 2 people = 4 portions (we don't do breakfast) which means we pay about $3/portion. Yes, I spend about an hour in the kitchen every day including cleanup.  Take that together with shopping and say it's 90 minutes for shopping, cooking and cleanup every day. Of course some days it's more some it's less - 90 minutes is the average and of course I don't go shopping every day - I'm just averaging the time spent.  
For the $3 per portion I can't do NY strip steak, but I can do fresh tacos entirely from scratch (including the tacos - which once you had homemade fresh tacos you'll never go back to those nasty packets from the store). I can do sushi, I can do all sorts of things that don't require ingredients exceeding $3/portion.  For me it's a challenge to go lower - ultimately I want to try a $1/portion month, but that will be stretching it.
In my book the cheapest and healthiest way to eat is to buy and cook yourself. People come up with all sorts of excuses why takeout, eating out, delivery services etc. are required to live. They're not, they're conveniences.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGK86tWMFjk&lc=UgxXXAzP_dEkQTH-Guh4AaABAg"

I was grateful but not impressed my meat was a day away from expiring in one meal another came with a beet root and one day it was hard the next rotten my garlic was blooming in our second week to see if I could do this. One meal came with an odd ""cauliflower"" that was pointy and just crumbled it really seemed like if I didn't cook the food with in three days it all went bad. I have not tried hello fresh but now that it's been a year of him passing and me figuring out different ways to taste food without making myself ill (aka not swallowing) I am back to trying to cook now only if I could get her to purchase food that can be combined into an actual meal of sorts would be good.

Of course anyone can use them but realistically, there comes a a point where the price outweighs the product. I considered a service like Blue Apron cause I wanted less food waste and to be more experimental but this convinces me not to. I would probably use it to try out some recipes every once in a while without having to commit to large portions you get at the store but I'll think I'll stick to grocery shopping otherwise.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGK86tWMFjk&lc=Ugy-58tYzg8smv5ULgd4AaABAg"

"jwathas",6/23/2017 7:30:38 PM,"none","HelloFresh hands down!!!  We've been with them for about 2-3 months now and we have loved every single meal.  We were with Blue Apron for about a month or so prior to switching to HelloFresh, but the meals that they offered weren't really our style or taste.  They were actually kind of out there (squid ink pasta, for example, was one...yuck).  On top of that, during our final week with Blue Apron, we received a totally bruised, spoiled squash that couldn't be used.  The produce and meats that HelloFresh sends are always extremely fresh and top quality.  We have referred soooo many friends and family as well as my husband's co-workers to sign up for HelloFresh through free weeks that we've given them and every single one of them has raved about it and continued their subscriptions!  We have also found HelloFresh's customer service to be top-notch.  One week, we had a meal that came with zucchini and the zucchini that we received was a bit on the small side, so I contacted them and what did they do???  They applied a full credit to our account so that our next week was free, all for a zucchini that we could have easily replaced for about a dollar!  Amazing!  One last thing that HelloFresh has over Blue Apron is the packaging.  With HelloFresh, the meals come very well organized in their own little boxes, making it much easier to fit them in the refrigerator.  Blue Apron just threw everything all in one big box and it was incredibly unorganized!","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGK86tWMFjk&lc=UgjeSEyu4-q2eXgCoAEC"

"Jacob Rindfleisch",5/20/2017 4:45:43 AM,"none","Well a lot of people have priced these out and this would actually be cheaper for you for a few reasons. One is that when you go to the store you tend to buy more than you need and thus wasting. Also, with the food presented to you in bulk at the store, you tend to buy more. That being said, you still need to go to the store but at the very least, you have three dinners ready for you and with possible leftovers. I'd say it's worth it. I already spend like 100-120 a week at the grocery store. So I spend 60 on dinners and then get some bread and other essentials. It would probably be the same or less and I'd have actual meals.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGK86tWMFjk&lc=Ughn4YxkNcGCvXgCoAEC"

I don't want extra food to put away for leftovers later.  Hello Kitty is much more basic and less challenging. Blue Apron stretched me and taught me more about flavors and actual cooking processes. PLUS Blue Apron is $10 less than Hello Fresh.  (to me, a single man that gets the 2 person package,  already have twice the portions I need, so I am getting 6 meals from the 2 people [x3] kit). I used to over eat. The BA portions are perfect for me and I'm still full. BTW, I am 6'4"" 260 and it's more than enough food to eat. I have yet to eat a serving and feel hungry or starving. LMAO. 
I found BA to be top quality, delicious and more of a challenge to cook, and found HK as basic less challenging and simpler recipes. So if you want to pay MORE and have simpler food recipes with less of a cooking challenge, by all means, pay more for less. If you enjoy high quality, near gourmet recipes, less waste, for less cost, try Blue Apron. 
*ALSO- Blue Apron delivers the package to my door without a signature by UPS. I've never had a problem with a delivery. Hello Fresh requires a signature and it was some random guy (not uniformed, not professional looking) in a white van (YIKES), and luckily I just so happened to be home when he came. I don't know what they would do with my package if I wasn't there when they came, but he was a bit creepy.
Let me define ""challenging"" = I don't mean it's hard or difficult, just more involved, more detailed and BA challenged me to prepare, organize and pay closer attention.  I could cook HK without their recipes or their ingredients without a lot of thought, and I've cooked nearly the same things before from the HK choices, so there was no excitement or anticipation. I would have never tried the Blue Apron recipes without this service and recipes cards. I am more satisfied cooking a gourmet meal and having it turn out near perfect to my tastes and my budget, plus I am challenged. 
My end result is; Blue Apron is the better choice for me.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGK86tWMFjk&lc=Ugg6_-GZdWU2engCoAEC"

"Maria Papa",3/2/2017 10:35:57 AM,"none","I tried both Blue Apron and Hello Fresh - I preferred Hello Fresh.  Then I tried Martha Stewarts box called Martha & Marley.  I compared them to Hello Fresh - even a touch better. So far - Martha also included free gifts in some of her boxes and best of all - I could do just two meals a week instead of three that Blue Apron and Hello Fresh had as the lowest amount of meals.  Plus the price was just $49.00.  I agree - just gave me something different to make and keep the recipes too.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGK86tWMFjk&lc=UgiDpk3z9ykljXgCoAEC"

"Patti-Jo Burtnett",3/1/2017 5:19:52 PM,"none","This was interesting. I of course see all the ads for these meal services but they never seemed worth it, mostly because I do like to cook and have the time to prepare meals. Still I was always curious about what really came in those boxes so thanks for doing the review.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGK86tWMFjk&lc=UgiqR7TSbjNMVngCoAEC"
